    "text": "High Perfoming Team Recipe\nToday, I’ll attempt to create a recipe for a high performing team. If you are familiar with Agile and Scrum you will immediately recognize the main ingredients for this sumptious meal. You will notice they are the Scrum values - and also the roots of the HPT above.\n\nIngredients\n\nA team\nVision\n1 cup Commitment\n1 cup of Focus\n1 cup of Openness\n1 Cup of Respect\n1 Cup of Courage\n\nPreparation time:  Depends on how fast ingredients fully blend.\n\n\nMethod\n\nSetup a team or take an existing team. You have to be observant on what stage the team is at (forming, storming, norming or performing?) - but really it does not matter, team dynamics (right skills and diversity, right size, norms and ground rules, right resources available?), and cognizant of any specific immediate challenges or issues the team is facing. The team can be co-located or remote. Team coaching is an essential enabler.\nAdd a vision to the Team and mix (yes, you got that right). Create a shared understanding of the vision. It is crucial for the team to have a compelling purpose that is clear, challenging and important - the vision should be inspiring to work towards.\nAdd 1 cup of commitment, mix. For a team to achive its goals and objectives members must commit to what they say they are going to do. Help the team to keep distractions at bay, allowing then to commit to a goal and mostly importantly team success. Team members should only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, to avoid overcommiting.\nAdd 1 cup of focus, mix. Now the team is able to focus on their commitments and do just that they have commited to and nothing else. Finish what you start.\nAdd 1 cup of openness, mix. The result is transparency - nothing is hidden, there is free flow of information, trust builds into the team, and members know what direction the team is headed. New ideas and opinions thrive, and there is no room for doubt in the team.\nAdd 1 cup of respect, mix. Everyone has a distict contribution they bring to the table, respecting everyone’s ideas and their individual unique traits ensures the team is able to work together collaboratively towards its goal. There is room to make mistakes as they are regarded as learning opportunities.\nAdd 1 cup of courage, mix. Yes, the team can do anything, and have the spirit to inspect and adapt. The team is adapted to change. The team does not fear sailing in uncharted waters.\nMix until fully blended.\n\nYou know the team is high-performing when you start to see extra-ordinary results, the team is creating the right business value (fast and frequently), and there is evident (and measurable) team and individual growth.\nLyssa on telling when the HPT has taken hold, concludes:\n\nIt’s when the team talks about the tree as a metaphor for themselves and their chosen pathway to high perfomance:\n\n‘We can grown if we stengthen our root.’\n\nThat’s when the power of metaphor shines through and becomes something useful to them, helping them survice turbulent change or reach for that next big goal.\n\n\n\nAdditional Reading and References\n\nCoaching Agile Teams\nWhat is SCRUM: A Guide to the Most Popular Agile Framework"

    "text": "My deep learning journey accelerated when my friend and a former comrade (thank you, Martin Chiteri) pointed me to the famous Practical Deep Learning for Coders course from Fast.ai - a free online course that will teach you how to apply practical deep learning and machine learning to train fast and accurate neural nerworks. The course is based on an equally great book Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch (also freely available online).\nfastai is a machine learning library built on top of PyTorch that provides a consitent interface to the most frequently used deep learning applications. It is extensively documented - see Resources section for links to important material.\nIn this guide, I share my experience setting up fastai on MacOS (with Apple silicon) and show you how to get started with development quickly.\nInstallation of fastai on MacOS is not supported. The good news, you can use fastai without installing it in your local machine - this is possible on Google Colab or Kaggle platforms.\nOften, I want to be able to work on projects locally. A good option is to use docker containers. I opted to setup a container enviroment."

I mapped ports using -p 8889:8888 (local port 8889 maps to the container’s jupyter instance running on port 8888).\n% docker run -it -p 8889:8888 -v ~/Dev/deep-learning:/data --name CONTAINER_NAME fastai-dl /bin/bash\nOnce inside the container I launched jupyter using the following command:\n% jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser\nVoila!

These attributes aids in driving high-perfomance at individual, team and organization levels - an outcome synonymous with agility.\nYou prioritize value-driven delivery of products, services and/or projects.\nTeams having this mindset tend to identify with: - Work in an Agile manner - Deliver business value quickly (and incrementally) and obtain feedabck to benefit the next delivery cycle (think of sprints) - Act in a transparent manner - Focus on delivering high priority work (with available resources) and avoid non-priority items - Adopt a servant leadership approach to benefit achievement of business and team goals - Self-organize - Influence others to embrace Agile\nOrganizations (or teams/individuals) eager for agility must be ready to respond effectively to change and embrace change by adopting a change mindset. Inversely, it becomes a futile undertaking without it - as you are bound to miss the mark in your journey to agility.\nChange is a constant in everything we do.\nAnd, in present business environment change is inevitable. Change could be triggered by a competitor introducing new rival product/service in the market, civil unrests caused by regime changes, changes in legislation affecting a product/service, pandemics, and what have you.\nWe must uncompromisingly either embrace change (and continous improvement) or perish! That’s an Agile mindset."
