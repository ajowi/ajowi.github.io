In June 2024, on a sunny Monday afternoon I received a phone call from a former colleage and a friend (NK - not his real name)  of many years. I had just taken lunch and was having a routine 15-minutes walk before heading back to my office. After catching up on life and family our conversation immediately shifted to a project NK was working on - The National Leprocy & Tuberculosis Program (NLTP) of Kenya was implementing a funded project to integrate medical AI software in 63 public health facilities across the 47 counties of Kenya. The $1.2 million project was being funded by Global Fund through Amref Health Africa to improve treatment of tuberculosis(TB) and lung diseases. Auxica Africa,  a local partner for Qure.ai in Kenya was leading the technical implementation

"I need help!", he posed. "With what, my friend?", I asked back. At this moment I stopped walking and stood beside a shadowy jacaranda tree along the walkway.

"We have integrated 15 sites. We need a technical lead for the remaining sites.", he continued. NK was leading the integration and was cutting his time to the project due to other commitments. Well, we discussed the project a bit and when he asked if I could step in to support - I said, Yes!

I had memorable experience leading the integration of `qTrack` (a medical AI appplication) in Kenya's public health facilities. AI's impact to our public healthcare system is abound with many benefits and opportunities. There are also lingering concerns on the preparedness of our public health facilities to embrace this revolutional technology - especially their IT infrastructure.

## Integrating qure.ai - qTrack

qTrack is an AI application developed by Qure.ai - a leading health tech company that uses deep learning and AI tools to make healthcare more accessible and affordable to patients worldwide. This is the application procured by the project for deployment in the public health facilities mapped to benefit from the project. Qure.ai says its solutions have successfully analyzed 1+ billion images, making it stand out as the most widely employed AI in healthcare. 

Hardware procured as part of the project is a Dell G5 gaming laptop (32GB GDDR6 RAM, 2TB storage, NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1660Ti) to host the application, acting as a server. Each site getting a laptop. 

qTrack was pre-configured and setup in all the laptops.

**How does it work?**

DICOM refers to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine - a standard format for transmitting and storing medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.

A screening routine for a patient (presenting TB-related symptoms) flows: patient data is captured captured before a scan is taken; X-Ray is taken; Images are pushed to qTrack for processing; Report generated with AI findings; Continue clinical process.

**Site requirements**

- Functional digital medical imaging equipment (Modality)
- Hospital Patient Management System (HMIS)
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Internet connection

**Integration workflow at a site**

- Initial site scoping - Check level of infrastructure readiness, Hospital Information System, internet, LAN, vLANs, IT team, Modality (medical equipment that processes X-Ray images)
- Configure Modality and add Qure laptop (server) as a destination
- Install Qure system 
- Testing
- User Training
- Facility-wide integration
- Handover
- Site closure

AI is supporting helthcare workers, not replacing them. Adoption of AI in the helthcare industry has rapidly grown in the past decade bringing with it efficiencies in patient management - by enabling faster diagnosis and reducing the workload of medical providers.

As we left a site medical officers were enthusing over the AI system we had just deployed and trained them on - an indication that they have embraced the technology.

Kenya has a shortage of radiologists - it is unbelievable to hear of counties having only one radiologist, or none at all. The AI system, within seconds, can process x-ray images and generate a report with accurate findings - pilot studies have shown that AI correctly diagnoses pulmonary TB with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100%. Previously, x-ray scans/films would pile and be queued for an overwhelmed radiologist (if they happen to be available) to intepret. The introduction of AI will shorten patient waiting times, lead to quick diagnosis and instat patient treatment, help hospitals save on costs associated with otherwise unnecesary molecular tests and improve efficiency - ultimately improving patient management.

**Lingering Concerns**

Major public hospitals in the counties are either Level 5-category Country Referral Hospitals or Level 4-category Sub-County Hospitals. The IT infrastructure in most of these facilities is wanting - from poorly designed networks to ill-equiped data centres server rooms. With the ever present demand for primary healthcare. The governments, both national and county, must prioritize robust hospital IT infrastructure if they are to benefit from technologies like AI which is here with us and promising to make healthcare affordable and quality.
The current state where most hospital IT equipment is donated by project 
- Poor internet connectivity

- There is lack of internal capacity to manage/fix breakdown of key installations like x-ray equipment leading to 

- Weak policies on patient data management - storage, security, privacy and governance should also be addresses
