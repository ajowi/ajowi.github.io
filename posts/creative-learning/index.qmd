Imagine working on a task. There is a standard process to follow. You have done this severally that you are now an expert. You get comfortable. You stop thinking. Undoubtedly, you perform well and the outcome meets the standards. Let's call this *L1 scenario*.

Now imagine working on a project. You are willing to take risks and try new things. You are not comfortable---constantly exploring, experimenting and testing. You come up with the most innovative and creative outcome. This is *L2 scenario*.

Today's volatile and constantly changing workplace, disrupted by rapid evolution in technologies and AI, demands for creative thinkers---people who can discover creative and innovative ways of working, allowing them to adapt to uncertainty and change. The future of the universe rests on their shoulders.
 
To think creatively you have to constantly learn, un-learn and re-learn---in creative ways. In his book, *Lifelong Kindergarten*, Mitchel Resnik advocates for kindergarten-style approach to learning. "I’m convinced that kindergarten-style learning is exactly what’s needed to help people of all ages develop the creative capacities needed to thrive in today’s rapidly changing society.", he writes. 

But, why this approach? 

Noteworthy, is the interactive creative learning process kindergarten children experience when building---say---a tower, using blocks. First, they imagine a fantasy tower. Then they start building the tower, then they constantly toy with and experiment with different heights and designs (the tower sometimes collapse), they collaborate and share ideas as they build. When the tower collapses they reflect and rebuild it based on the new information they just discovered. Finally, based on these experiences, they imagine even more ideas to improve their new creation.

Resnik calls it the Creative Learning Spiral. In this process, learners "...develop their own ideas, try them out, experiment with alternatives, get input from others, and generate new ideas based on their experiences."

Creative learning is an interactive process that involves working collaboratively with others on projects (or things) we have a passion for through enjoyful experimentation. Creative learning should be embedded in our education systems and businesses.

Unfortunately, in Kenya (and many countries globally) the  education system is in a mess---designed to systemically produce *L1 scenarios*. There is no room for students to question content they consume, they copy notes---verbatim---from text books, are made to work on boring assignments and study only to pass exams. This must change if we want to build a society of creative thinkers. There is an urgent need to incorporate learning methods that encourage creativity and innovation---like introducing project-based activities early. Interventions need to start at the grassroots, with solid systems put in place to entrench a creative learning culture. 

For educators and parents, some tools for children---developed by Resnik's lab---I recommend you try out and that I have been using with my children are: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [OctoStudio](https://octostudio.org). 

For companies and business leaders, the kindergarten-style approach to learning is akin to agility. Adopting agile frameworks like SCRUM founded on strong principles that encourage experimentation, continuous improvement and delivery, collaboration and adaptation will lead to creative thinkers and innovators in your teams.
