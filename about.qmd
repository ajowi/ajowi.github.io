Welcome! I am David Ajowi: an IT professional currently based in Nairobi, Kenya. 

Since 2019, I develop software and support teams to maximize business value by adopting agile practises. I have had the privilege of leading diverse technical teams, overseeing successful product launches, building enterprise IT infrastructure, and providing IT leadership for global enterprises.

I write about my own personal experiences, learnings and thoughts - on work and life. Luckily, you find and take away something useful in my sharing.
